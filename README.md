# FlightProject

Android application that finds the best path between airports given criteria. Redacted some files to follow U of U SoC policy.

Based on a flight criteria, such as price, distance, or time, the application will determine the best list of airports that you should take and the path’s cost. This uses Dijkstra's algorithm to decide what path to take. The app uses data from the entire year of 2017, and may be outdated. 

This is an application that builds off of what a partner and I made in our Algorithms and Data Structures class. The files shown in this project is the front end of the application, while the back end was what we developed in class, and will not be shown to anyone else also taking the class. No files of the back end are shown besides MainActivity.java (developed by me, outside of class), which is used to make the connection between the XML files and the back end code. 

All of the code here was made by me, other code, such as the assignment’s code, will not be shown. The flight_data.csv was given to us for the assignment to allow us to test our code, and was not gathered by me. The code shown is to show how most of the app works, and will not work without the rest of it.
